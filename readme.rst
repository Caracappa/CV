Curriculum Vitae : Rachel N. Slaybaugh
________________________________________________________________

This repository contains my curriculum vitae source files and pdfs
of two versions: full and summary. 

In order to build my cv from the source, try pdflatex. You'll need the
accompanying resume2.cls file.

Thanks for your interest.
Thanks also to Katy Huff from whose repo I forked and Trey Hunner, so
provided materials I adapted as well.
